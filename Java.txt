  avadoc comments are typically written before the declaration of fields, methods, and classes

println vs print
  println moves the curser to the next line 
  while print just moves it forward from the previouse string.

System.out.println();
  System is a built-in Java class that contains useful tools for our programs.
  out is short for “output”.
  println is short for “print line”.
